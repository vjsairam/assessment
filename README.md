# Project Name

This project contains Kubernetes YAML configurations for deploying services and ingresses.

## Overview

The project provides a set of YAML files that can be used to deploy services and ingresses in a Kubernetes cluster. The configurations include deployments, services, and ingresses to facilitate the deployment of the applications.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and deploy the services and ingresses in the Kubernetes cluster.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster: You should have access to a running Kubernetes cluster. This can be a local cluster such as Kind or Minikube, or a cloud-based cluster.
- `kubectl` command-line tool: Install and configure `kubectl` to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

### Deployment

To deploy the services and ingresses, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>


2. Deploy the Kubernetes objects:

   ```bash
    kubectl apply -f <project-directory>

3. Verify the deployment:

   ```bash
    kubectl get deployments
    kubectl get services
    kubectl get ingresses
    
This will display the deployed deployments, services, and ingresses in the Kubernetes cluster. Ensure that the resources are created and running successfully.

4. Configuration

The project includes the following configurations:

deployment.yaml: This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment for an HTTP echo service. 
service.yaml: The YAML file contains the configuration for a Kubernetes Service to expose the HTTP echo service. 
ingress.yaml: The YAML file configures a Kubernetes Ingress to route traffic based on hostnames.
